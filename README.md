### History: 

Welcome to the world of LostGem, an epic adventure game that will take you into a world full of dangers and mysteries. You will take control of four brave heroes: a skilled knight, a cunning Druid, a powerful mage and a brave valkyrie. Each of them has unique skills that will be essential to overcome the challenges they will face.

The game is divided into three exciting levels, each with its own setting and set of enemies. In the first level, you'll explore the forest, where hordes of skeletons hide among the trees. In the second phase, you'll enter the cemetery and face an even more relentless army of skeletons. Finally, in the third stage, you'll reach the boss's castle, where a powerful vampire guards the mythical jewel "Opal".

You'll have to use all your skill and strategy to guide your heroes through each level, avoiding traps, dodging enemies and collecting treasures along the way. Each stage will be an ever-increasing challenge, requiring you to learn from your mistakes and adapt quickly to survive.

But the final reward is worth it: if you and your heroes manage to overcome the obstacles and reach the vampire's castle, you will face one of the most challenging bosses of all time. And if you manage to beat the vampire and take the "Opal" from him, then you will win the game and become a real hero.

So get ready for the adventure of a lifetime with LostGem, where you'll guide your heroes through an incredible journey, facing dangers and saving the world!
